# credit-card-default-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting credit card default

Objective:
The main goal of this project is to build an accurate predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payments. By identifying potential defaulters early on, financial institutions can take preventive measures and offer appropriate solutions to customers facing financial difficulties.

Data:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/350/default+of+credit+card+clients.zip

The dataset used for training and testing the model includes historical credit card transaction data, customer demographics, past payment behavior, credit limit, and other relevant features. The data is preprocessed and carefully analyzed to handle missing values and outliers.

Modeling:
Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, are employed to build predictive models. The models are fine-tuned and compared to identify the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.

Evaluation:
The predictive model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness. Additionally, a confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis are used to assess the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying defaulters and non-defaulters.

Usage:
The repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The trained model can be used for credit card default prediction on new data, making it valuable for financial institutions seeking to manage credit risk effectively.

Dependencies:
The required Python libraries and their versions are listed in the requirements.txt file for easy installation using pip.

Contributions:
Contributions to the project, such as improvements to the model, additional features, or data exploration, are welcome. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the repository for submitting pull requests.
